# ROBO-SAVIOR

Pilot a powerful robot to defend a city from an alien invasion. As waves of enemies attack, you must balance intense combat with crucial internal repairs to keep your robot operational. Balance two scales: on a human scale to repair the robot and on a gigantic scale in the battles between the alien invaders.  Made for 2024 GMTK Game Jam with prompt "Built To Scale".
